# Currency-Notes-Identification

While being on my learning journey of Deep Leaning, this is the first DL model that I built using the keras library and a standard neural network.The model can be used to identify if the currency note is real or fake and showed 99% accuracy when tested. The model was made using the dataset provided for the practice purpose, gathered from the real currency notes' images. The data and the python code used to built the model can be provided on special requests.
