# Fake Currency Note Classifier

## Overview
This project marks my initial venture into Deep Learning, showcasing a neural network model built using the Keras library. The primary goal is to classify currency notes as either genuine or fake, achieving an impressive 99% accuracy during testing.

## Model Details
Library: Keras

Architecture: Standard Neural Network

## Dataset
The dataset employed for training is proprietary and utilized solely for practice purposes. Real currency note images were collected to create a diverse and representative dataset.

## Note
For security reasons, the dataset and the original notebook are not included in this repository. However, on special requests, I am open to providing the data and code used to construct the model.

Feel free to explore, modify, or inquire about any aspect of the project. Your feedback is always appreciated.
